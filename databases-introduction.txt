Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: A database should be used when we need a way to store data that makes it easy to search for specific data, that can handle multiple applications accessing the data, and that persists beyond the end of a particular application process. We would use a text file if we are dealing with a single user, one at a time write access or when using unstructured data. 


Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is a declarative rather than a procedural language.

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.


A: Databases are structured like tables and they allow users to manage them through an interface such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The table has one or more rows and columns, which define what the data represents. Each cell in the table contains a particular data value. Relational databases use SQL to create/edit/view/delete data. 


Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A:

-Table: a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of columns, and rows.

-Row: represents a structured data item in a table. Each row in a table represents a set of related data, and every row in the table has the same structure.

-Column: a set of data values of a particular simple type, one value for each row of the database.

-Value: Values in a database represent a specific data attribute for a specific instance or entry.
